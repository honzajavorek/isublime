# iSublime

Uploads files to iCloud. To _sublime_ means to pass something directly from the solid to the vapor ☁️ state.

## Why?

With iSublime, I can connect my external hard drive and backup some files to my iCloud without them necessarily taking up space on my computer's hard drive.

## TODO

- [ ] retry on weird network or iCloud errors
- [ ] get username and password from keychain
- [ ] won't delete any files or dirs on iCloud
