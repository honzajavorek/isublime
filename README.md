# iSublime

Uploads files to iCloud. To _sublime_ means to pass something directly from the solid to the vapor ☁️ state.

## Why?

With iSublime, I can connect my external hard drive and backup some files to my iCloud without them necessarily taking up space on my computer's hard drive.

## TODO

- [ ] first it should read files from disk, identify folders, create them remotely, then sync files
- [ ] super slow
- [ ] won't delete any files or dirs on iCloud
